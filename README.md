## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome Space Traveller! 
This is a choose your own adventure story. A mysterious creature has transported you to a remote outpost station in Space. You don’t recognise the stars or planets, but outside you see a rainbow of colours that take your breath away, you must be in a nursery nebula. 

To help the mysterious creature you will be asked to make decisions and input your responses on your journey. 
Along the way you may encounter some challenges and puzzles to test your skills and knowledge!
